Code used for data analysis and generating figures

1. NADP/NADPH deconvolution for calculating NADPH redox active hydride labelling (NADP_NADPH_deconvolution.m).
Used for processing data for Figure 2A and 3B. 
  
2. Simulating the effect of changing water exchange and substrate laeblling on NADPH redox hydride labelling (SubLab_WaterEx.m).
Used for generating Figure 4.
  
3. Simulating the effect of comparmtentation (Compartmented_model.m).
Used for generating Figure 5.
